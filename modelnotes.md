# Ideas for the Cringe model

## Raw text
- More wholistic traing on what "cringe" is
- Less work and processing
- May require more tuning as there is much more unknown

## Segmented text
- Understand at sentence/paragraph level
- Easier to store and process
- Less wholistic understanding of cringe
- Does not work well on all types of cringey posts

## Processed text
- Understands which words/word combinations are cringey
- Smallest building blocks of cringe
- Would only understand specifics of cringe and not cringe at a larger level
